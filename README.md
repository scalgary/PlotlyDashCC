First experimentation with Dash and Plotly.
I tried to reproduce a basid Dashboard that I made in Apache Superset.
was hosted in Heroku for some time but I stopped when Heroku stopped offering a free hosting service.
Without a server--> no interactivity
My potential users won't want to use Docker to run the app on their machine.
Was a nice learning project but can't see yet how to turn out in a real product for our clients
